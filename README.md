# this is my voxel engine: Dioxane.

-Ultimately this engine's goal is to be able to host .vxl maps, and set up the infrastructure needed for huge voxel maps that can allow real time destruction/modification.
- this engine should support multiplayer as well as languages like lua for user created content

## TODO: 

- GPU: Use rasterization
- use brickmapping for voxel data structure
